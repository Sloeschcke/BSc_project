#Abstract
Uncertain graphs are widely used for representing the inherent uncertainty in complex systems.
This project reviews and extends the work of Jin et al. [1], by studying the problem of discover-
ing the k most reliable subgraphs in uncertain graphs. This problem is relevant in the analysis
of many network applications, such as social networks, network routing, and protein-protein
interaction networks. As the problem is #P-complete, and thus computationally intractable, a
sampling scheme is introduced to provide -approximations with high probability. In doing
this, the problem is transformed to the problem of discovering the k most frequent cohesive
sets in the setting of deterministic graphs. This transformation gives way to an eager and atten-
tive approach. The eager approach combines peeling techniques and an iterative version of the
Apriori algorithm to give approximate solutions with certain -guarantees. To ensure that the
correct top-k results are found with high probability, the attentive approach builds on top of
the eager approach by adding a progressive sampling step. The eager and attentive approaches
allow for a trade-off between efficiency and precision. Extensive experiments verify that the
novel approaches provide significant improvements compared to naively extending the work
of Jin et al. to the top-k setting.
